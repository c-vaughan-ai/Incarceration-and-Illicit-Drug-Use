This paper examines the correlation between a stateâ€™s rate of incarceration and its rate of illicit drug use. Using economic crime models,
it will attempt to determine the effects of incarceration on illicit drug use and suggest reform to public policy. This analysis finds that
increasing incarceration does reduce rates of illicit drug use. However, further research needs to be done to determine if this is the most
cost-effective solution to lower rates of drug use. Current research has evaluated the effectiveness of other options to combat drug use
and used in conjunction with these findings, public policy can reconsider its approach to dealing with drug offenses.
